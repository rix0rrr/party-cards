Party Cards
-----------

Node.js app to share postcards with pictures from a mobile phone to a laptop
attached to a beamer. Perfect for parties (we used it at our office's christmas
party).

People use their mobile phone to go to a webpage to submit their cards (you
should create a short URL for it). The app can also grab everything that's
posted to a Twitter hashtag.

No config file right now, you'll need to edit app.js to tweak it.
